I won't accept "contributions" per se, but if you have nifty dotfiles you think I'd like fire me a message on [twitter](http://twitter.com/Hatcrab). I'm always on the lookout for cool stuff to ~~steal~~ ~~pilfer~~ ~~appropriate~~ borrow.

People whose dotfiles/tips I've cannibalized, in no particular order:
